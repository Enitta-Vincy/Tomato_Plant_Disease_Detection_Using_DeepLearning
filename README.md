**# Tomato_Plant_Disease_Detection_Using_DeepLearning**:
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with transfer learning (MobileNetV2) to detect and classify various diseases in tomato plants based on leaf images. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of tomato leaf images and can accurately identify common diseases like Early Blight, Late Blight, and Leaf Mold, along with healthy leaves. It also includes real-time prediction support using a webcam or mobile camera.

**Features**:
Deep learning-based image classification
Preprocessing with image augmentation
Transfer learning using MobileNetV2
Real-time disease detection from camera
Detailed prediction with symptoms and possible solutions

**Technologies Used**:
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
OpenCV
NumPy / Pandas / Matplotlib

**Usage**:
Upload leaf images or capture them in real time
Get predictions along with disease details
Useful for farmers, researchers, and agri-tech applications

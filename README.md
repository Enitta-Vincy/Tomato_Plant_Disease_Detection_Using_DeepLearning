# Tomato_Plant_Disease_Detection_Using_DeepLearning
This project uses a deep learning model (MobileNetV2) to detect and classify diseases in tomato plant leaves from images. It helps identify diseases like Early Blight, Late Blight, and Leaf Mold, and also supports real-time prediction using a camera.
